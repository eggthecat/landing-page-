              <p>I grew up in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hp-neighborhood-spotlight-20170401-story.html">Playa Del Rey</a> on the southern coast of California.  I enjoyed <a href="https://www.ymcala.org/westchester/programs/youth-swim-lessons">swimming</a>, <a href="https://beaches.lacounty.gov/la-county-beach-bike-path/">cycling</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34FmXlmF5tY">video games</a>, <a href="http://www.malibucreekstatepark.org/">hiking</a>, <a href="https://www.visitcalifornia.com/region/discover-high-sierra">camping</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ouXz86qkYE">sailing</a> as hobbies. My K-12 education was adminsitered by the <a href="http://www.la-archdiocese.org/Pages/default.aspx">Archdiocese of Los Angeles</a>.</p>  <p>Despite all this I had no interest in becoming involved with the budding Tech scene of Silicon Beach.</p>

              For the next ten years I received my formal education from a handful of local community colleges and a vocational nursing school where I was received an associates degree in nursing.  I maintained employment through major retail corporations and several boat rental establishments from Long Beach to Ventura.  I finally had enough of lving in LA and moved to Portland

              I've done dabbled in several lines of work within multnomah county since moving to Portland.  i've installed toilets, sandblasted and painted, monitored security systems, set up appointments, and delivered huggies on miserable, rainy sundays.  When I was working I was either crafting furniture, racking up my netflix exposure, or chasing the idea of "just one more shot".  As of 2017 I've been interested in changing my career to "coding".  I view coding as a way to understand the machines I use and I want to integrate it more into my daily life through work and hobbies.  Now I'm trying my second attempt at the Epicodus Boot Camp experience.
